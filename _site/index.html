They were submitted anonymously and have not been edited.</p><blockquote><p>I couldn’t recommend this class enough! I’m a second year CS-LSA student and I’m taking this class as my first ULCS class with EECS 281. Despite not having the strongest foundation in linear algebra coming in, I’ve found the material very accessible with a bit of extra effort. The lectures, led by Suraj, are both engaging and informative; he has a talent in presenting complex ideas in a clear and interesting way that keeps you interested. The homework assignments are particularly cool—they push you to think creatively while applying what you’ve learned in class. The course is manageable with consistent effort, and I’ve found the resources provided by the staff to be helpful for filling in any gaps. If you’re interested in diving deeper into data science and machine learning concepts, I’d definitely recommend taking this course.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As a third year data science major, this has been my favorite course I’ve taken throughout my time in college. It’s the first course that’s felt tailored to my major and relevant to the industry. I’ve loved the combination of learning core Python skills and ML techniques, and have gained a breadth of understanding in just a semester. While the homework can be time-consuming and challenging, it’s so worth it to gain a better understanding of class content. Not only that, but the concepts taught have helped me excel while interviewing for data science roles, and even land multiple offers. Also, the course staff are amazing – they’re incredibly intelligent and friendly, I’ve always had a great experience in office hours. Would highly recommend this course to anyone interested in data science!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>This is one of my favorite classes I’ve taken at umich. I have enjoyed the content of almost every lecture, and I wish I had taken this class before my past internship because it would’ve helped a ton. I really appreciate the structure of this course, with weekly homeworks and a good amount of late days, but not enough to fall behind. I actually don’t have a single complaint about how this class is run. The professor gives out a grade report after the midterm, so we can see how many points we have in the class so far, what our current grade is, and how many late days we have remaining. I took linear algebra at a community college and learned pretty much nothing, but I still felt as though I could keep up because of the provided linear algebra review. I would recommend this course to anyone!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>As a CS senior, this is one of the best courses I’ve taken at Michigan! The course is incredibly well organized: each week’s homework and discussion worksheet aligns well with the content covered in lecture, staff is very open to feedback, and the workload is very reasonable with consistent effort and doable alongside other difficult courses. Suraj is also such an engaging lecturer, and his notes/presentations are a really great mix of content, interactive demos, and practice problems. I would definitely recommend this course!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Coming into this class, I hadn’t had too much experience with Python and Data Science in general, so I was a bit unsure of how it would go. However, the result was completely unexpected: I now find myself really enjoying the course content not only because it is taught in an engaging way but also because I can see the value in the practical applications that come out of these concepts. Every week, even if I was unsure about a certain topic, I knew I could either come to office hours and get the help I needed, or reinforce those concepts through the homework problems, which really helped me build confidence in my understanding of the material. Most importantly, the course can really help you realize an interest for this content that you may have never known to have, as it did with me: I now am pursuing future courses like Machine Learning because the content in this class was taught so well and gave me a good foundation for future ULCS classes. Overall, the course is meant to challenge you, but it is quite rewarding in the end, and it is an enjoyable experience!</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>I think this course should be required for any DS (or frankly even CS major). There’s a lot to learn in the class. Although we spend a rather brief amount of time covering some of the topics, this class gives a great idea of lot’s of things out there. It may be called practical data science, but the second half goes more into depth for a decent mathematical understanding of basic, but crucial, ML components. There’s lot’s of skills you pick up through it (SQL, Pandas, Latex, Numpy, SciKit Learn, Plotly, Regex, etc.). I also believe that the course is what you make of it. Suraj, and the staff, put in a lot of time to gather resources to you can dwell deeper into areas of interest.</p><p>My main cons of the course are that it’s not were related to depth, regarding some APIs such as Pandas. If you’re more into lower level programming (computer architecture, systems, DSA in C/C++), then this may not be the course for you. Although if you want a chill class which teaches you a thing or two, I’d say check it out. Bare through the initial few weeks and the content get’s pretty sweet! Believe me, I went through it myself.</p><p>Make sure you know your linear algebra if you really want to appreciate the content in the second half of the course!</p><p>I think the ideal time to take the course is right after 203 and 280, probably alongside 281. Not only are you locking yourself into some internship experience (especially in today’s ML heavy workforce) but also get to branch into some other areas.</p></blockquote><p>While official evaluations for Fall 2024 aren’t yet available, we administered an anonymous survey at the end of Fall 2024 that asked students about the course’s workload. The results are shown below.</p><center><img src="../assets/marketing/workload.png" width="700" /></center></main></div></div><div class="search-overlay"></div></div>
