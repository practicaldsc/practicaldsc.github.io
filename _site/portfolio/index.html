📊</h1><ul><li><a href="#checkpoint-submission">Checkpoint</a> due <strong>Monday, November 25th at 11:59PM</strong> (no slip days allowed!)<li>Final Submission due <strong>Saturday, December 7th at 11:59PM</strong> (no slip days allowed!)</ul><p><em>last updated November 5th at 9:49PM</em></p><hr /><p>Welcome to Portfolio Homework, the final homework assignment of the semester! 👋</p><p>This homework is a mini-homework of sorts, and aims to be a culmination of everything you’ve learned this semester. In the homework, you will conduct an open-ended investigation into one of the three datasets (Recipes and Ratings 🍽, League of Legends ⌨️, or Power Outages 🔋), or – upon permission of the instructor – choose your own. <strong>Specifically, you’ll draw several visualizations to help understand the distributions of key variables, build and improve a predictive model, and share your findings with everyone on the internet.</strong></p><p>The Portfolio Homework is worth 100 points total; the breakdown is described in the <a href="#rubric">Rubric</a> section at the bottom of this page. The Portfolio Homework is different from other homeworks in a few crucial ways:</p><ul><li>You <strong>can work with one partner</strong> (but don’t have to). If you choose to work with a partner, read the <a href="#partner-guidelines">Partner Guidelines</a> section at the bottom.<li>There is a <strong>checkpoint</strong>, due right before Thanksgiving, worth 15 points out of the 100 points the homework is scored out of. It exists to make sure you’ve picked a dataset and started some preliminary work. See the <a href="#checkpoint-submission">Checkpoint Submission</a> section for more details and for the Gradescope submission link.<li>You <strong>cannot use slip days</strong> on either the checkpoint or the final submission, since they’re due so close to the end of the semester that we need all the time we can get to grade them. All components of the homework are <strong>manually graded</strong>.<li>You <strong>cannot drop</strong> the Portfolio Homework – it will be a part of your overall homework grade no matter what. Your lowest score among Homeworks 1-11 will be the one that is dropped.<li>As your final deliverables, you’ll submit two things to us:<ul><li>a <strong>public-facing website</strong>. We’ll eventually create a public “showcase” site that has links to everyone’s submissions – <strong>that is, your website will be available to the entire internet!</strong><li>a <strong>PDF of your Jupyter Notebook</strong>.</ul></ul><p>Before we get into the details of what’s expected of you, note that this homework in particular is meant to encourage you to build something you’re proud of. This is a chance to put something concrete on your resume to show potential employers. Grading will likely be lenient, but your work will be publicly available <strong>forever</strong>!</p><p>As alluded to above, the homework is broken into two parts:</p><ul><li>Part 1: An <strong>analysis</strong>, submitted as a Jupyter Notebook. This will contain the details of your work. <strong>Focus on completing your analysis before moving to Part 2, as the analysis is the bulk of the homework.</strong><li>Part 2: A <strong>report</strong>, submitted as a website. This will contain a narrative “story” with visuals. <strong>Focus on this after finishing <em>most</em> of your analysis.</strong></ul><p>The homework is worth a total of 100 points. You can see the distribution of points in the <a href="#rubric">Rubric</a> section at the very bottom.</p><hr /><h2 class="no_toc text-delta" id="table-of-contents"> <a href="#table-of-contents" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="table-of-contents"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Table of Contents</h2><ol id="markdown-toc"><li><a href="#choosing-a-dataset" id="markdown-toc-choosing-a-dataset">Choosing a Dataset</a><ol><li><a href="#default-options" id="markdown-toc-default-options">Default Options</a><li><a href="#choosing-your-own-dataset" id="markdown-toc-choosing-your-own-dataset">Choosing Your Own Dataset</a></ol><li><a href="#part-1-analysis" id="markdown-toc-part-1-analysis">Part 1: Analysis</a><ol><li><a href="#step-1-introduction" id="markdown-toc-step-1-introduction">Step 1: Introduction</a><li><a href="#step-2-data-cleaning-and-exploratory-data-analysis" id="markdown-toc-step-2-data-cleaning-and-exploratory-data-analysis">Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis</a><li><a href="#step-3-framing-a-prediction-problem" id="markdown-toc-step-3-framing-a-prediction-problem">Step 3: Framing a Prediction Problem</a><li><a href="#step-4-baseline-model" id="markdown-toc-step-4-baseline-model">Step 4: Baseline Model</a><li><a href="#step-5-final-model" id="markdown-toc-step-5-final-model">Step 5: Final Model</a><li><a href="#style" id="markdown-toc-style">Style</a></ol><li><a href="#part-2-report" id="markdown-toc-part-2-report">Part 2: Report</a><ol><li><a href="#step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site" id="markdown-toc-step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site">Step 1: Initializing a Jekyll GitHub Pages Site</a><li><a href="#step-2-choosing-a-theme" id="markdown-toc-step-2-choosing-a-theme">Step 2: Choosing a Theme</a><li><a href="#step-3-embedding-content" id="markdown-toc-step-3-embedding-content">Step 3: Embedding Content</a><li><a href="#local-setup" id="markdown-toc-local-setup">Local Setup</a></ol><li><a href="#submission-and-rubric" id="markdown-toc-submission-and-rubric">Submission and Rubric</a><ol><li><a href="#checkpoint-submission" id="markdown-toc-checkpoint-submission">Checkpoint Submission</a><li><a href="#final-submission" id="markdown-toc-final-submission">Final Submission</a><li><a href="#rubric" id="markdown-toc-rubric">Rubric</a></ol><li><a href="#partner-guidelines" id="markdown-toc-partner-guidelines">Partner Guidelines</a></ol><hr /><h2 id="choosing-a-dataset"> <a href="#choosing-a-dataset" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="choosing-a-dataset"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Choosing a Dataset</h2><p>In this homework, you will perform an open-ended investigation into a <strong>single dataset</strong>.</p><h3 id="default-options"> <a href="#default-options" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="default-options"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Default Options</h3><p>We expect that the majority of students will choose <strong>one</strong> of the following three datasets.</p><p><a href="recipes-and-ratings" class="btn">Recipes and Ratings 🍽</a>    <a href="league-of-legends" class="btn">League of Legends ⌨️</a>    <a href="power-outages" class="btn">Power Outages 🔋</a></p><p>The dataset description pages linked above each have three sections:</p><ul><li><strong>Getting the Data</strong>: Describes how to access the data and, in some cases, what various features mean.

These examples offer insights into crafting effective research questions, but bear in mind that they have their own strengths and weaknesses. Treat them as a foundation for inspiration, but <strong>don’t</strong> just repeat or copy their work – be original! Also note that the UC San Diego version of this assignment had slightly more requirements, so you’ll see sections involving (for example) hypothesis tests that you aren’t expected to have.</p><ol><li><a href="https://krystalqjx.github.io/LOL-analysis/">League of Legends First Blood Statistical Analysis</a>: This homework excelled in clarifying their research aims, making the study understandable to a broader audience.

If that’s the case, you <em>may</em> be permitted to use a different dataset. <strong>To request approval</strong>, send Suraj (rampure@umich.edu) an email with the following:</p><ol><li>A one paragraph description of why you’ve chosen this dataset and your plans for analysis. Comment on what draws you to this dataset over the default options, what preliminary questions you plan to answer, and what features you plan to use in a predictive model. Part of our filtering is making sure that your plans are sufficiently scoped for the homework – that is, your proposal is neither too easy nor too difficult – so the more details, the better.<li>Proof that you already have access to the data you want to work with. Ideally, attach a link to the data source or the file so that we can see it ourselves and verify that your plans are possible.</ol><p><strong>The deadline to request approval to use a different dataset is the same as the deadline of the checkpoint, November 25th.</strong> Once you email Suraj with the above, you should hear back within 48 hours with your approval or denial and reasoning. Note that submitting the checkpoint is not the same as requesting approval; the only way to request approval to use a different dataset is to email Suraj with answers to the questions above. After November 25th, if you haven’t requested approval, you <strong>must</strong> choose one of the default three options.</p><hr /><h2 id="part-1-analysis"> <a href="#part-1-analysis" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="part-1-analysis"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Part 1: Analysis</h2><p>Before beginning your analysis, you’ll need to set up a few things.</p><ol><li>Pull the latest version of the course GitHub repo, <a href="https://github.com/practicaldsc/fa24">github.com/practicaldsc/fa24</a>.

Show the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">head</code> of your cleaned DataFrame (see <a href="#part-2-report">Part 2: Report</a> for instructions).<tr><td><strong>Univariate Analysis</strong><td>Look at the distributions of relevant columns separately by using DataFrame operations and drawing at least two relevant plots.<td>Embed <strong>at least one</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plot you created in your notebook that displays the distribution of a single column (see <a href="#part-2-report">Part 2: Report</a> for instructions). Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present, and how they answer your initial question. (Your notebook will likely have more visualizations than your website, and that’s fine. Feel free to embed more than one univariate visualization in your website if you’d like, but make sure that each embedded plot is accompanied by a description.)<tr><td><strong>Bivariate Analysis</strong><td>Look at the statistics of pairs of columns to identify possible associations. For instance, you may create scatter plots and plot conditional distributions, or box plots. You must plot at least two such plots in your notebook. Be creative!<td>Embed <strong>at least one</strong> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plot that displays the relationship between two columns. Include a 1-2 sentence explanation about your plot, making sure to describe and interpret any trends present and how they answer your initial question.

If you are building a classifier, make sure to state whether you are performing binary classification or multiclass classification. Report the response variable (i.e. the variable you are predicting) and why you chose it, the metric you are using to evaluate your model and why you chose it over other suitable metrics (e.g. accuracy vs. F1-score).<br /><br /><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: Make sure to justify what information you would know at the “time of prediction” and to only train your model using those features.

Implement all steps (feature transforms and model training) in a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sklearn</code> Pipeline. <br /><br /><strong><em>Note</em></strong>: <strong>Both now and in Step 5: Final Model, make sure to evaluate your model’s ability to generalize to unseen data!</strong> <br /><br />There is no “required” performance metric that your baseline model needs to achieve.<td>Describe your model and state the features in your model, including how many are quantitative, ordinal, and nominal, and how you performed any necessary encodings. Report the performance of your model and whether or not you believe your current model is “good” and why.<br /><br /><strong><em>Tip</em></strong>: Make sure to hit all of the points above: many Portfolio Homeworks in the past have lost points for not doing so.</table></div><h3 id="step-5-final-model"> <a href="#step-5-final-model" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-5-final-model"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step 5: Final Model</h3><div class="table-wrapper"><table><thead><tr><th>Step<th>Analysis in Notebook<th>Report on Website<tbody><tr><td><strong>Final Model</strong><td>Create a “final” model that improves upon the “baseline” model you created in Step 4. Do so by engineering at least two new features from the data, on top of any categorical encodings you performed in Baseline Model Step. (For instance, you may use a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StandardScaler</code> on a quantitative column and a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">QuantileTransformer</code> transformer on a different column to get two new features.) Again, implement all steps in a single <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">sklearn</code> Pipeline. While deciding what features to use, you <strong>must</strong> perform a search for the best hyperparameters (e.g. tree depth) to use amongst a list(s) of options, either by using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GridSearchCV</code> or through some manual iterative method. In your notebook, state which hyperparameters you plan to tune and why before actually tuning them.<br /><br /><strong><em>Optional</em></strong>: You are encouraged to try many different modeling algorithms for your final model (i.e. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">LinearRegression</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RandomForestClassifier</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Lasso</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SVC</code>, etc.) If you do this, make sure to clearly indicate in your notebook which model is your actual final model as that will be used to grade the above requirements.<br /><br /><strong><em>Note 1</em></strong>: When training your model, make sure you use the same training and testing sets from your baseline model. This way, the evaluation metric you get on your final model can be compared to your baseline’s on the basis of the model itself and not the dataset it was trained on. Based on which method you use for hyperparameter tuning, this may mean that you will need to use some of your training data as your validation data. If this is the case, make sure to train your final model on the whole training set to evaluation.<br /><br /><strong><em>Note 2</em></strong>: You will not be graded on “how much” your model improved from Step 4: Baseline Model to Step 5: Final Model. What you will be graded on is on whether or not your model improved, as well as your thoughtfulness and effort in creating features, along with the other points above.<br /><br /><strong><em>Note 3</em></strong>: Don’t try to improve your model’s performance just by blindly transforming existing features into new ones. Think critically about what each transformation you’re doing actually does. For example, there’s no use in using a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">StandardScaler</code> transformer if your goal is to reduce the MSE of a linear model: as we learned in Lecture 18, standardizing features in a regression model does not change the model’s predictions, only its coefficients!<td>State the features you added and <strong>why</strong> they are good for the data and prediction task. Note that you can’t simply state “these features improved my accuracy”, since you’d need to choose these features and fit a model before noticing that – instead, talk about <em>why</em> you believe these features improved your model’s performance from the perspective of the data generating process. <br /><br />Describe the modeling algorithm you chose, the hyperparameters that ended up performing the best, and the method you used to select hyperparameters and your overall model. Describe how your Final Model’s performance is an improvement over your Baseline Model’s performance.<br /><br /><strong><em>Optional</em></strong>: Include a visualization that describes your model’s performance, e.g. a confusion matrix, if applicable.</table></div><h3 id="style"> <a href="#style" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="style"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Style</h3><p>While your website will be neatly organized and tailored for public consumption, it is important to keep your analysis notebook organized as well. Follow these guidelines:</p><ul><li>Your work for each of the five homework steps described above (Introduction, Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis, …, Final Model) should be completed in code cells underneath the Markdown header of that section’s name.<li>You should <strong>only include work that is relevant</strong> to posing, explaining, and answering the question(s) you state in your website. You should include data quality, cleaning, and missingness assessments, and intermediate models and features you tried, though these should broadly be relevant to the tasks at hand.<li>Make sure to clearly explain what each component of your notebook <strong>means</strong>. Specifically:<ul><li>All plots should have titles, labels, and a legend (if applicable), even if they don’t make it into your website. Plots should be self-contained – readers should be able to understand what they describe without having to read anything else.<li>All code cells should contain a comment describing how the code works (unless the code is self-explanatory – use your best judgement).</ul></ul><hr /><h2 id="part-2-report"> <a href="#part-2-report" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="part-2-report"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Part 2: Report</h2><p>The purpose of your website is to provide the general public – your classmates, friends, family, recruiters, and random internet strangers – with an overview of your homework and its findings, without forcing them to understand every last detail. We don’t expect the website creation process to take very much time, but it will certainly be rewarding. Once you’ve completed your analysis and know <em>what</em> you will put in your website, start reading this section.</p><p>Your website must clearly contain the following five headings, corresponding to the five steps mentioned in <a href="#part-1-analysis">Part 1</a>:</p><ul><li>Introduction<li>Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis<li>Framing a Prediction Problem<li>Baseline Model<li>Final Model</ul><p><strong>Don’t</strong> include “Step 1”, “Step 2”, etc. in your headings – the headings should be exactly as they are above.</p><p>The specific content your website needs to contain is described in the “Report on Website” columns above. <strong>Make sure to also give your website a creative title that relates to the question you’re trying to answer, and clearly state your name(s) and email(s).</strong></p><p>Your report will be in the form of a <em>static</em> website, hosted for free on GitHub Pages. More specifically, you’ll use <a href="https://jekyllrb.com">Jekyll</a>, a framework built into GitHub Pages that allows you to create professional-looking websites just by writing Markdown (<a href="https://practicaldsc.org">practicaldsc.org</a> is built using Jekyll!). GitHub Pages does the “hard” part of converting your Markdown to HTML.</p><p>If you’d like to follow the official <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/about-github-pages-and-jekyll">GitHub Pages &amp; Jekyll</a> tutorial, you’re welcome to, though we will provide you with a perhaps simpler set of instructions here. A very basic site with an embedded visualization can be found at <a href="http://rampure.org/dsc80-proj3-test1/">rampure.org/dsc80-proj3-test1/</a>; the source code for the site is <a href="https://github.com/surajrampure/dsc80-proj3-test1">here</a>. Note that this example site doesn’t have the same headings that you’re required to have.</p><h3 id="step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site"> <a href="#step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-1-initializing-a-jekyll-github-pages-site"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step 1: Initializing a Jekyll GitHub Pages Site</h3><ol><li>Create a GitHub account, if you don’t already have one.<li>Create a new GitHub repository for your homework. Give it a descriptive name, like <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">league-of-legends-analysis</code>, not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">eecs398-portfolio-hw</code>.<ul><li>GitHub Pages sites live at <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">&lt;username&gt;.github.io/&lt;reponame&gt;</code> (for instance, the site for <a href="https://github.com/practicaldsc/fa24">github.com/practicaldsc.org/fa24</a> is <a href="https://practicaldsc.github.io/fa24">practicaldsc.github.io/fa24</a>, which we redirect to from <a href="https://practicaldsc.org">practicaldsc.org</a>).<li>As such, <strong>don’t</strong> include “EECS 398” or “Portfolio Homework” in your repo’s name – this looks unprofessional to future employers, and gives you a generic-sounding URL. Instead, mention that this is a homework for EECS 398 at U-M in the repository description.<li><strong>Make sure to make your repository public.</strong><li>Select “ADD a README file.” This ensures that your repository starts off non-empty, which is necessary to continue.</ul><li>Click “Settings” in the repository toolbar (next to “Insights”), then click “Pages” in the left menu.<li>Under “Branch”, click the “None” dropdown, change the branch to “main”, and then click “Save.” You should soon see “GitHub Pages source saved.” in a blue banner at the top of the page. This initiates GitHub Pages in your repository.<li>After 30 seconds, reload the page again. You should see “<strong>Your site is live at http://username.github.io/reponame/</strong>”. Click that link – you now have a site!<li>Click “Code” in the repo toolbar to return to the source code for your repo.</ol><p>Note that the source code for your site lives in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>. <strong>As you push changes to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>, they will update on your site automatically within a few minutes!</strong> Before moving forward, make sure that you can make basic edits:</p><ol><li>Clone your repo locally.<li>Make some edits to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>.<li>Push those changes back to GitHub, using the following steps:<ul><li>Add your changes to “staging” using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git add README.md</code> (repeat this for any other files you add).<li>Commit your changes using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m '&lt;some message here&gt;'</code>, e.g. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git commit -m 'changed title of website'</code>.<li>Push your changes using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">git push</code>.</ul></ol><p>Moving forward, we recommend making edits to your website source code locally, rather than directly on GitHub. This is in part due to the fact that you’ll be creating folders and adding files to your source code.</p><h3 id="step-2-choosing-a-theme"> <a href="#step-2-choosing-a-theme" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-2-choosing-a-theme"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step 2: Choosing a Theme</h3><p>The default “theme” of a Jekyll site is not all that interesting.</p><p>To change the theme of your site:</p><ol><li>Create a file in your repository called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>.<li>Go <a href="https://pages.github.com/themes/">here</a>, and click the links of various themes until you find one you like.<li>Open the linked repository for the theme you’d like to use and scroll down to the “Usage” section of the README. Copy the necessary information from the README to your <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code> and push it to your site.</ol><p>For instance, if I wanted to use the Merlot theme, I’d put the following in my <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yml</code>:</p><div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">remote_theme</span><span class="pi">:</span> <span class="s">pages-themes/merlot@v0.2.0</span>
<span class="na">plugins</span><span class="pi">:</span>
  <span class="pi">-</span> <span class="s">jekyll-remote-theme</span> <span class="c1"># add this line to the plugins list if you already have one</span>
</code></pre></div></div><p>Note that you’re free to use any Jekyll theme, not just the ones that appear <a href="https://pages.github.com/themes/">here</a>. You are required to choose <em>some</em> theme other than the default, though. See more details about themes <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/adding-a-theme-to-your-github-pages-site-using-jekyll">here</a>.</p><h3 id="step-3-embedding-content"> <a href="#step-3-embedding-content" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="step-3-embedding-content"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Step 3: Embedding Content</h3><p>Now comes the interesting part – actually including content in your site. The <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/">Markdown cheat sheet</a> contains tips on how to format text and other page components in Markdown (and if you’d benefit by seeing an example, you could always look at the Markdown source of <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/practicaldsc/fa24/gh-pages/portfolio/index.md">this very page</a> – meta!).</p><p>What will be a bit trickier is embedding <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plots in your site so that they are interactive. Note that you are <strong>required</strong> to do this, you cannot simply take screenshots of plots from your notebooks and embed them in your site. Here’s how to embed a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plot directly in your site.</p><ol><li>First, you’ll need to convert your plot to HTML. If <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig</code> is a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Figure</code> object (for instance, the result of calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">px.express</code>, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">go.Figure</code>, or <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.plot</code> when <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">pd.options.plotting.backend = "plotly"</code> has been run), then the method <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig.write_html</code> saves the plot as HTML to a file. Call it using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig.write_html('file-name.html', include_plotlyjs='cdn')</code>.<ul><li>Change <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">'file-name.html'</code> to the path where you’d like to initially save your plot.<li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">include_plotlyjs='cdn'</code> tells <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">write_html</code> to load the source code for the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> library from a server, rather than including the entire source code in your HTML file. This drastically reduces the size of the resulting HTML file, keeping your repo size down.</ul><li>Move the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.html</code> file(s) you’ve created into a folder in your website repo called <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">assets</code> (or something similar).<ul><li>Depending on where your template notebook is saved, you could combine this step with the step above by calling <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">fig.write_html</code> with the correct path (e.g. `fig.write_html(‘../league-match-analysis/assets/matches-per-year.html’)).</ul><li>In <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">README.md</code>, embed your plot using the following syntax:</ol><div class="language-html highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span>
  <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">"assets/file-name.html"</span>

  <span class="na">frameborder=</span><span class="s">"0"</span>
<span class="nt">&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</span>
</code></pre></div></div><ul><li><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">iframe</code> stands for “inline frame”; it allows us to embed HTML files within other HTML files.<li>You can change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">width</code> and <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">height</code> arguments, but don’t change the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">frameBorder</code> argument.</ul><p>Refer <a href="https://rampure.org/dsc80-proj3-test1/#assessment-of-missingness">here</a> for a working example (and <a href="https://github.com/surajrampure/dsc80-proj3-test1">here</a> for its source code).</p><p class="note">Try your best to make your plots look professional and unique to your group – add axis labels, change the font and colors, add annotations, etc. Remember, potential employers will see this – you don’t want your plots to look like everyone else’s! If you’d like to match the styles of the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">plotly</code> plots used in lecture (e.g. with the white backgrounds), you can import and use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lec_utils.py</code> file that’s in the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">homeworks/portfolio</code> folder of our public repo, alongside <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">template.ipynb</code>.</p><p>To convert a DataFrame in your notebook to Markdown source code (which you need to do for both the <strong>Data Cleaning</strong> and <strong>Interesting Aggregates</strong> sections of Step 2: Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis in Part 1), use the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.to_markdown()</code> method on the DataFrame. For instance,</p><div class="language-py highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">counts</span><span class="p">[[</span><span class="s">'semester'</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">'Count'</span><span class="p">]].</span><span class="n">head</span><span class="p">().</span><span class="n">to_markdown</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">index</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">False</span><span class="p">))</span>

You can see how this appears <a href="http://rampure.org/dsc80-proj3-test1/#assessment-of-missingness">here</a>; remember, no screenshots (and also remember that the “Assessment of Missingness” title is not something you need to have, that’s just an example website). You may need to play with this a little bit so that you don’t show DataFrames that are super, super wide and look ugly.</p><h3 id="local-setup"> <a href="#local-setup" class="anchor-heading" aria-labelledby="local-setup"><svg viewBox="0 0 16 16" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="#svg-link"></use></svg></a> Local Setup</h3><p>The above instructions give you all you need to create and make updates to your site. However, you <em>may</em> want to set up Jekyll locally, so that you can look at how changes to your site would look without having to push and wait for GitHub to re-build your site. To do so, follow the steps <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">here</a> and then <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/testing-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll">here</a>.</p><blockquote class="red"><p>If, after running the above steps, running <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle exec jekyll serve</code> in your local website repository doesn’t work, then follow these steps.</p><ol><li>In your Terminal, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cd</code> to your local website repository (folder).<li>Run <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">bundle init</code> to create a Gemfile (a file that specifies which Ruby extensions your project needs).<li>Open the Gemfile created in your local repository, delete everything that’s currently there, and replace it all with:<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>source "https://rubygems.org"

Keep the following points in mind:</p><ol><li>You are both required to actively contribute to all parts of the project. You must both be working on the assignment at the same time together, either physically or virtually on a Zoom call. You are encouraged to follow the <strong>pair programming model</strong>, in which you work on just a single computer and alternate who writes the code and who thinks about the problems at a high level. <strong>In particular, you cannot split up the project and each work on separate parts independently.</strong> So, you <strong>cannot</strong> say Partner 1 is responsible for the analysis and Partner 2 is responsible for the website.<li>You should decide on your partnership as soon as possible, but certainly before the checkpoint deadline of November 25th (which you’re required to submit on your own).<li>Ultimately, you will submit three deliverables for this homework to three separate Gradescope assignments – the checkpoint, a PDF of your notebook, and a link to your website. <strong>Make sure to have just one partner submit these deliverables, and have them tag the other partner!</strong> That is, don’t make duplicate submissions of the same work.</ol></main></div></div><div class="search-overlay"></div></div>
