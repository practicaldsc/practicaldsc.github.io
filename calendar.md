# ðŸ“† Calendar

_last updated Monday, June 16th_

Office hours for the remainder of the semester are on Zoom by appointment only. There are slots every day leading up to the Final Exam, including Saturday and Sunday. Sign up for as many slots as you'd like at the link below.

<div align="center" markdown="1">
<a class="btn" style="background-color: #e6804d; color: white;" href="https://calendar.app.google/qrKNHCLQzmU5JYCm6">Make an office hours appointment here</a> 
</div>

The deadline to sign up for a slot is 2 hours before the slot, so that I know to expect you. When it's time for your appointment, join [**this**](https://umich.zoom.us/j/95923283134) Zoom link.


<!-- [**here**](https://calendar.app.google/qrKNHCLQzmU5JYCm6). -->

<!-- The times and locations of office hours, as well as lectures and study sessions, are all in the calendar below. **The times of office hours are subject to change week-to-week, so make sure to check the calendar before attending.**

We will not be using the Office Hours Queue this semester â€“ look for [Suraj or Abhi](../staff) in office hours.

<!-- **If attending in-person office hours**, put your name on the [Office Hours Queue](https://eecsoh.eecs.umich.edu/queues/2lbxJSrtWrZBa1wAlRt1mI4E3ha) so that we know who we're looking for!

<!-- The events are color-coded:
- Deadlines appear in <span style="color:#d50101"><b>red</b></span>.
- Lectures and study sessions appear in <span style="color:#668cd9"><b>blue</b></span>. These are all held on North Campus. As mentioned in the [Syllabus](../syllabus), we are holding study sessions in place of discussion sections this term. Study sessions are designed to be group office hours, i.e. focused blocks of time for working on homeworks in groups, with the help of the TA.
- In-person office hours appear in <span style="color:#e0c23f"><b>gold</b></span>. These are typically held either in the BBB Atrium or a BBB conference room. **Note that most in-person office hours can also be accessed remotely**.
- Remote office hours appear in <span style="color:#e6804d"><b>orange</b></span>, and can be accessed at the Zoom link below.

**Can't make it to any of the office hours? Send Suraj an email at rampure@umich.edu.**
