    "Welcome to Homework 1! In this homework, you will practice with core features of the Python language, including defining functions, writing conditional statements and loops, and working with lists and strings. You'll also gain experience in reading documentation to figure out how to work with unfamiliar libraries. See the [Readings section of the Resources tab on the course website](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/#readings) for supplemental resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "You are given six slip days throughout the semester to extend deadlines. See the [Syllabus](https://practicaldsc.org/syllabus) for more details. With the exception of using slip days, late work will not be accepted unless you have made special arrangements with your instructor.\n",
    "\n",
    "To access this notebook, you'll need to clone our [public GitHub repository](https://github.com/practicaldsc/fa24/). The [⚙️ Environment Setup](https://practicaldsc.org/env-setup) page on the course website walks you through the necessary steps. Once you're done, you'll submit your completed notebook to Gradescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "Please start early and submit often. You can submit as many times as you'd like to Gradescope, and we'll take your **most recent** submission. Remember that the public `grader.check` tests in your notebook are not comprehensive, and that your work will also be graded on hidden test cases on Gradescope after the submission deadline.\n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is worth a total of **40 points**. The number of points each question is worth is listed at the start of each question. **The four parts of the assignment are independent**; with the exception of Part 1, in which the questions build off one another, you can complete the questions in any order.
