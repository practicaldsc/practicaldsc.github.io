    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "In this part of the homework, you'll replicate the PageRank algorithm, the algorithm that Google uses to decide how to rank search results. Along the way, you'll develop proficiency with using arrays in the context of linear algebra.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "Larry Page and Sergey Brin developed the Google search engine (originally known as \"BackRub\") while PhD students at Stanford University. Their key innovation was the **PageRank** algorithm. PageRank works by assigning each page on the internet a \"score\" based on its relative importance. Today, PageRank is one of the many algorithms that Google uses in determining how to rank search results.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll give an explanation of the necessary components of PageRank here, but you may also want to refer to these slides, which inspired our exposition: [**The Billion Dollar Eigenvector**](https://jdc.math.uwo.ca/M1600b-2014/l/pagerank-1600.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key idea: The more incoming links a page has, the more important it is!**\n",
    "\n",
    "<center>\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"imgs/network.png\" width=300><br><small>An example network of pages.</small>\n",
    "    \n",
    "</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few naïve approaches to scoring pages given that key idea, but they have their flaws:\n",
    "- One idea: the score of a page is equal to the number of pages that link to it. This doesn't work because it doesn't account for the importance of the incoming links. For example, if my personal website links to [apple.com](https://apple.com), that doesn't make [apple.com](https://apple.com) any more important than it already was. But if [apple.com](https://apple.com) links to my personal website, that must mean my personal website is important!\n",
    "- Another idea: The score of a page is equal to the sum of the scores of the pages that link to it. This also doesn't work, because there is no non-zero solution!\n",
    "\n",
    "The actual solution assigns scores to pages such that **when a page links to several other pages, the score it gives to them is shared**.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example graph above, we see that:\n",
    "- Page 1 links to Page 2.\n",
    "- Page 2 links to Pages 1 and 4.\n",
    "- Page 3 links to Pages 1 and 4.\n",
    "- Page 4 links to Pages 1, 2, and 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we let $x_i$ be the score assigned to Page $i$, we're looking for the solution to the equations:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\begin{align*}\n",
    "x_1 &= &\\frac{1}{2}x_2 &+ \\frac{1}{2}x_3 &+ \\frac{1}{3}x_4 \\\\\n",
    "x_2 &= x_1 &&           &+ \\frac{1}{3}x_4 \\\\\n",

    "x_4 &= &\\frac{1}{2}x_2 &+ \\frac{1}{2}x_3\n",
    "\\end{align*}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A more concise way to express the system above is in matrix form, which we can do like so:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{x} = A \\vec{x}, \\qquad A = \\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "0 & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{2} & \\frac{1}{3} \\\\\n",

    "\\end{bmatrix} \\qquad \\vec x = \\begin{bmatrix} x_1 \\\\ x_2 \\\\ x_3 \\\\ x_4 \\end{bmatrix}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "**Our goal**: Given an adjacency matrix $A$, find the solution to the equation $\\vec{x} = A \\vec{x}$. We will return to solving this goal in Question 2, but keep it at the back of your mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "For now, we'll aim to understand the structure of adjacency matrices.\n",
    "- Each **column** of an adjacency matrix describes the movement **from** a given page; the sums of the columns in an adjacency matrix are equal to 1.\n",

In our example $A$, since $\\vec x \\in \\mathbb{R}^4$, we'd initialize $\\vec x^{(0)} = \\begin{bmatrix} \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ \\frac{1}{4} \\\\ \\frac{1}{4} \\end{bmatrix}$. You can imagine this means that a user is equally likely to be on any of the four pages before clicking anything.\n",
    "1. Simulate the process of the user clicking one link by multiplying $A$ by $\\vec x^{(0)}$, and call this $\\vec x^{(1)}$, our next guess of the true $\\vec x$. In other words, $\\vec x^{(1)} = A \\vec x^{(0)}$.\n",
    "2. Repeat this again, so $\\vec x^{(2)} = A \\vec x^{(1)} = A^2 \\vec x^{(0)}$.\n",
    "3. Repeat many, many times, until the difference between $\\vec x^{(i)}$ and $\\vec x^{(i-1)}$ is minimal.\n",
    "\n",
    "Eventually, our guesses $\\vec x^{(i)}$ will converge on the true value of $\\vec x$, which we can interpret as containing the probability that a user is on any particular page in the long run. **Larger probabilities mean more important pages!**\n",

    "In short, to estimate $\\vec x$, we evaluate $A^{m} \\vec x^{(0)}$, where $m$ is some large integer and $x^{(0)}$ is a uniform vector. $m = 100$ is usually sufficient.\n",
