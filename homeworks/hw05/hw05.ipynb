    "Welcome to Homework 5! In this homework, you will work with and wrangle real-world data from websites & APIs. We'll be writing some HTML, scraping it from the web and parsing it, and making requests to APIs to build structured DataFrames from JSON. See the [Readings section of the Resources tab on the course website](https://practicaldsc.org/resources/#readings) for supplemental resources.\n",

Once you're done, you'll submit your completed notebook to Gradescope.\n",

The API we will work in this question is hosted by Financial Modeling Prep, and can be found at https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#daily-chart-charts. Specifically, we will use the \"**Daily Chart EOD**\" endpoint – search for it at the linked page.\n",

    "Some relevant definitions:\n",
    "- Ticker: A short code that refers to a stock. For example, Apple's ticker is AAPL and Ford's ticker is F. \n",
    "- Open: The price of a stock at the beginning of a trading day.\n",
    "- Close: The price of a stock at the end of a trading day.\n",
    "- Volume: The total number of shares traded in a day.\n",
    "- Percent change: The difference in price with respect to the original price, as a percentage.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make requests to the aforementioned API, you will need an API key. **In order to get one, you will need to make an account at the website.** Once you've signed up, you can use the API key that comes with the free plan. It has a limit of 250 requests per day, which should be more than enough. You will have to encode your API key in the URL that you make requests to; see a complete example of such a request at the [**documentation**](https://site.financialmodelingprep.com/developer/docs#Stock-Historical-Price)."
