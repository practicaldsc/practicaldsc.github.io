Course Instructor: Prof. Qing Qu

Course Time: Mon/Wed 12:00 PM – 1:30 PM,  3 credit hour

Office Hour: Wed 3:30 PM – 5:00 PM

Prerequisite: EECS 351, or EECS 301, or any linear algebra courses

Notice: This is an entry-level ECE machine learning course targeted for senior EE & CE undergraduate, and junior master students outside SIPML area. All students outside EECS that want to learn the basics of ML are also welcome! Compared to EECS 445, this course places slightly greater emphasis on mathematical principles and is better suited for students who have limited experience with programming and machine learning. 

Overview: The class will cover basic principles in machine learning, such as unsupervised learning (e.g., clustering, mixture models, dimension reduction), and supervised learning (e.g., regression, classification, neural networks & deep learning). For each topic, key algorithmic ideas/intuitions and basic theoretical insights will be highlighted.

Course Materials: slides and videos will be accessed via Canvas (TBA). Tentative topics that will be covered in this course are supervised learning, unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning:

Basics of probability, linear algebra, and optimization
Regression and linear prediction
Support vector machines and kernel methods
Deep neural networks
Dimension reduction: PCA, autoencoder
Clustering (Kmeans, Mixture of Gaussians, EM)
Representation learning: nonnegative matrix factorization, dictionary learning
Assessment: (i) 5 homework assignments (40%), (ii) mid-term exam (30%), (iii) course projects (25%), (iv) participation & course evaluation (5%)
